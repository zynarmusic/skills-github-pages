      Zynar began his musical journey as a dnb and hip hop dj during his college years. 
      Life and career goals made pursuing music difficult. 
      However once a raver, always a raver. 
      Six years ago Zynar decided to give music another shot or else live with regret. 
      Sampling from hip hop and inspired by sound design from dnb, Zynar offers a fresh take on house music.
